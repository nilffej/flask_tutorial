Hello, I made this Flask tutorial to help introduce the most
basic parts of Flask. 

Before you start developing, you'll need to install Flask
through the terminal and setup something called a virtual
environment.

A virtual environment is essentially what the name suggests.
It's a virtual environment for you to run your Flask app on.

You can setup a virtual environment in your home directory (~)
and then just use it for all Flask related projects instead
of creating a new venv for every project as the tutorial
linked below will suggest.

Virtual Environment and Flask setup:
https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/installation/

You can name your venv anything. I named mine 'asgard'.
I also set up this alias in my terminal (.bashrc file) so
that I can activate my virtual environment from anywhere
instead of navigating to the directory everytime.

alias venv='. ~/[YOUR VENV NAME]/Scripts/activate'

For MacOS, 'activate' will be located in
'~/[YOUR VENV NAME]/bin/activate'

Whenever you are finished with your Flask coding session,
to close your virutal environment, just run the command:
$ deactivate

After you're done installing, checkout the 'example_basic/'
directory for an introduction to Flask.
